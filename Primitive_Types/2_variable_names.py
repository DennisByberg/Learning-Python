# Best Practices for Naming Variables in Python:
# 1. Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable.
# 2. Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words (snake_case).
# 3. Avoid using single character names except for counters or iterators.
# 4. Do not use Python reserved keywords as variable names.
# 5. Keep the names concise but meaningful.
